# Dotfiles

## Setup


## Todo
* [ ] scripts directories - need to determine how I want things set up/how to run them
  - I'm thinking something like scripts/osx.install.sh and having an install.sh which
  runs each of the *.install.sh scripts in the folder. The individual install files come
  from the tags/hosts which are installed initially
  - I would like to be able to create individual Brewfiles for each tag
  - Would be nice to rework the zsh prompt so that it only included git or rbenv
  components when those tags are installed
  - OR some kind of dependency system for tags
* [x] Add SSH config to host-uranium
