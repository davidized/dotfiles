# Dotfiles

## Setup


## Todo
* [ ] Add Sublime Text settings/preferences - IN PROGRESS - still need to finish install.sh script
* [ ] Git aliasas could use some work
* [ ] gnupg - Symlink ~/.gnupg to ~/.secret/gnupg
* [ ] Install scripts that create symlinks should probably verify whether or not they exist first and prompt to backup or delete existing files

## Resources
The following articles and repositories have provided ideas and code that have come in handy as I've created my dotfiles.
