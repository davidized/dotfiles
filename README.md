# Dotfiles
The dotfiles (and a few other random helpful files) I currently have on my computer. Since my primary computers are Macs currently most everything is pretty Mac centric. At some point I may get around to updating things so that they work on Linux as well, but there is no pressing need for that at the moment.

I consider this a work in progress and I try to keep things as up to date as possible as I install or remove tools. That being said, please use anything in this repository at your own risk. Especially the install scripts as I don't actually use them all that much myself and am not 100% sure they're safe to run without screwing up your stuff.

## Setup
* My dotfiles live in ~/.dotfiles with some of my more sensitive items living in ~/.secret (ssh, gpg, etc).
* Run the ./install script to set everything up.


## Todo
Moved to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/davidized/dotfiles/issues)

## Other Notes
The history for this repo is a bit wonky as I removed some sensitive files from it before putting it up on github. As a result the commit messages may reference files or changes that no longer exist.
